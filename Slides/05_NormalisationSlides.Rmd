## Outline

* Motivation
* Biases
    * Depth bias
    * Composition bias
    * Mean-variance correlation
* Normalisation strategies
* Deconvolution

## Workflow

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/workflow2.png')
```

## Workflow

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/workflow2_normalisation.png')
```

## Raw UMI counts distribution

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/PBMMC_1_counts_before_norm.png')
```

## Why do UMI counts differ among the cells?

* We derive biological insights downstream by comparing cells against each other.
* But the UMI count differences makes it harder to compare cells.

* Why do total transcript molecules (UMI counts) detected between cells differ?
  * Biological:
    * Cell subtype differences - size and transcriptional activity, variation in gene expression
  * Technical: scRNA data is inherently noisy
    * Low mRNA content per cell
    * cell-to-cell differences in mRNA capture efficiency
    * Variable sequencing depth
    * PCR amplification efficiency

Normalization reduces technical differences
so that differences between cells are not technical but biological,
allowing meaningful comparison of expression profiles between cells.

## Depth bias

Depth bias: Read differences between cells

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/normalisation_toy_example.png')
```

Simple library size normalization accounts for the depth bias

## Composition bias

* Few genes contribute to most read counts
* In this example, the total read counts are the same across the cells
* Gene 1 contributes 80% of reads in cell2, leaving other genes with fewer read counts.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/composition_bias.jpg')
```

* Library size normalization can not correct composition bias.

* The deconvolution approach will we use takes account of both depth and compositions biases

## Mean-variance correlation

Mean and variance of raw counts for genes are correlated

More highly expressed genes tend to look more variable because larger numbers result in higher variance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='right', out.width= "60%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/variance_mean_uncorrected.png')
```

A gene expressed at a low level tends to have a low variance across cells:

var(c(2,4,2,4,2,4,2,4)) = 1.14

A gene with the same proportional differences between cells, but expressed at a higher level will have higher variance:

var(c(20,40,20,40,20,40,20,40)) = 114.29

## Mean-variance correlation

If we take the logs of the expression values, the variances are the same for both genes:

var(log(c(2,4,2,4,2,4,2,4))) = 0.14 

var(log(c(20,40,20,40,20,40,20,40))) = 0.14

```{r echo=FALSE, , fig.align='right', out.width= "60%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/variance_mean_uncorrected.png')
```

This "variable stabilising transformation" helps to remove the correlation between mean and variance

## General principle behind normalisation

Normalization has two steps

1. Scaling
    * Calculate size factors or normalization factors that represents the relative depth bias in each cell
    * Scale the counts for each gene in each cell by dividing the raw counts with cell specific size factor
  
2. Transformation: Transform the data after scaling
    * Per million (e.g. CPM)
    * log2 (e.g. Deconvolution)
    * Pearson residuals (eg. sctransform)

## Bulk RNAseq methods are not suitable for scRNAseq data

CPM: convert raw counts to counts-per-million (CPM)

* for each cell
* by dividing counts by the library size then multiplying by 1.000.000.
* does not address compositional bias caused by highly expressed genes that are also differentially expressed between cells.

DESeq’s size factor

* For each gene, compute geometric mean across cells
* For each cell
    * compute for each gene the ratio of its expression to its geometric mean,
    * derive the cell’s size factor as the median ratio across genes.
* Not suitable for sparse scRNA-seq data as the geometric mean is computed on non-zero values only.
  
## Bulk RNA-seq normalization methods fail for scRNA-seq data

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/size_factors_plot.png')
```

## Deconvolution

Deconvolution strategy [Lun et al 2016](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0947-7/):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../Images/scran_Fig3c2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Steps:

* compute scaling factors by pooling cells
* apply scaling factors to get scaled data
* log2 transform the data

## Recap

* We get different total counts for each cell due to technical factors (depth bias)
* A simplistic library size normalisation (e.g. CPM) removes a large part of this bias
* However, composition bias causes spurious differences between cells
* Early methods developed for bulk RNA-seq are not appropriate for sparse scRNA- seq data.
* The deconvolution method draws information from pools of cells to derive cell- based scaling factors that account for composition bias in scRNA-seq data.

In the demonstration and exercises we will see the effect of deconvolution on the data.
