# Introduction

In this section we are going to cover the basics of feature selection and 
dimensionality reduction. These methods allow us to represent our 
multi-dimensional data (with thousands of cells and thousands of genes) in a 
reduced set of dimensions for visualisation and more efficient downstream 
analysis. 

In feature selection the principle is to remove those genes which are uninteresting or uninformative to both improve computation and because this 'noise' reduction will hopefully enable us to more clearly see the true biology in our data. We make the assumption that most of the low level variance is not caused by real biology and is due to stochastic sampling in the single cell protocol and various other technical effects. The genes which have the most variance are therefore the ones that reflect the real biological difference and are what we want to focus on. This is obviously not a perfect assumption but it is a good way to make informed interpretations from your data that you can hopefully have a little more confidence in.

In dimensionality reduction we attempt to find a way to represent all the the information we have in expression space in a way that we can easily interpret. High dimensional data has several issues. There is a high computational requirement to performing analysis on 30,000 genes and 48,000 cells (in the Caron dataset). Humans live in a 3D world; we can't easily visualise all the dimensions. And then there is sparsity. As the number of dimensions increases the distance between two data points increases and becomes more invariant. This invariance causes us problems when we try to cluster the data into biologically similar groupings. By applying some dimensionality reducing methods we can solve these issues to a level where we can make interpretations.

# Setup

Before we start, let's load our packages and read our data in. 

```{r load_packages, eval=FALSE}
library(scater) 
library(scran)
library(PCAtools)
library(tidyverse)
```

We will load the _SingleCellExperiment_ object generated in the
[Normalisation](05_Normalisation.html) section, which contains normalised counts
for 500 cells per sample. For demonstration purposes we are not using the full dataset but you would in your analyses.

```{r read_data, cache=FALSE}
sce <- readRDS("R_objects/Caron_normalized.500.rds")
sce
```

To make some of our plots later on easier to interpret, we will replace the
rownames of the object (containing Ensembl gene IDs) with the gene symbol.
Sometimes it happens that there is no gene symbol and in some cases there
are multiple genes with the same symbol (see e.g. RGS5). A safe way to handle
these cases is to use the `uniquifyFeatureNames()` function, which will add the
Ensembl gene id to symbols where necessary to distinguish between different
genes.

```{r set_rownames_to_symbols}
rownames(sce) <- uniquifyFeatureNames(rownames(sce), rowData(sce)$Symbol)
```


# Feature Selection

We often use scRNA-seq data in exploratory analyses to characterize
heterogeneity across cells. Procedures like clustering and dimensionality
reduction compare cells based on their gene expression profiles, which involves
aggregating per-gene differences into a single (dis)similarity metric between
every pair of cells. The choice of genes to use in this calculation has a major
impact on the behavior of the metric and the performance of downstream methods.
We want to select genes that contain useful information about the biology of the
system while removing genes that contain random noise. This aims to preserve
interesting biological structure without the variance that obscures that
structure, and to reduce the size of the data to improve computational
efficiency of later steps.

The simplest approach to feature selection is to select the most variable genes
based on their expression across the population. This assumes that genuine
biological differences will manifest as increased variation in the affected
genes, compared to other genes that are only affected by technical noise or a
baseline level of “uninteresting” biological variation (e.g., from
transcriptional bursting). Several methods are available to quantify the
variation per gene and to select an appropriate set of highly variable genes
(HVGs).

## Quantifying per-gene variation

Some assays allow the inclusion of known molecules in a known amount covering a
wide range, from low to high abundance: spike-ins. The technical noise is
assessed based on the amount of spike-ins used, the corresponding read counts
obtained and their variation across cells. The variance in expression can then
be decomposed into the biological and technical components. There is discussion over whether this step is necessary but like all of the decisions you make in your analyses it would be wise to optimise your parameters and steps over several iterations with a view to existing biological knowlegde and controls.

The commonly used UMI-based assays do not (yet?) allow spike-ins. But one can still identify highly variable genes (HVGs), which likely capture biological variation.
Assuming that, for most genes, the observed variance across cells is due to
technical noise, we can assess technical variation by fitting a trend line
between the mean-variance relationship across all genes. Genes that
substantially deviate from this trend may then be considered as highly-variable,
i.e. capturing biologically interesting variation. The `scran` function 
`modelGeneVar` with carry out this estimation for us. 

The resulting output gives us a dataframe with all our genes and several columns. It has modeled the mean-variance relationship and from there it has estimated our total variance along with what it considers is the biological and technical variance. 

```{r mean_variance_model}
gene_var <- modelGeneVar(sce)

gene_var
```

We can then plot variance vs mean for each gene and visualise the limit of
technical variance according to the fitted trend line. We would regard those features below the trend line as technical noise.

```{r mean_variance_plot}
gene_var %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean, total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = tech), colour = "dodgerblue", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Mean of log-expression", y = "Variance of log-expression")
```


## Selecting highly variable genes 

Once we have quantified the per-gene variation, the next step is to select the
subset of HVGs to use in downstream analyses. A larger subset will reduce the
risk of discarding interesting biological signal by retaining more potentially
relevant genes, at the cost of increasing noise from irrelevant genes that might
obscure said signal. It is difficult to determine the optimal trade-off for any
given application as noise in one context may be useful signal in another.
Commonly applied strategies are:

* take top X genes with largest (biological) variation

Top 1000 genes: `getTopHVGs(gene_var, n=1000)` 

Top 10% genes: `getTopHVGs(gene_var, prop=0.1)`

* based on significance 

`getTopHVGs(gene_var, fdr.threshold = 0.05)`

* keeping all genes above the trend 

`getTopHVGs(gene_var, var.threshold = 0)`

* selecting a priori genes of interest 

In our example, we will define ‘HVGs’ as the top 10% of genes with the highest
biological component. This is a fairly arbitrary choice. A common practice is to
pick an arbitrary threshold (either based on number of proportion) and proceed
with the rest of the analysis, with the intention of testing other choices
later, rather than spending much time worrying about obtaining the “optimal”
value.

```{r get_hvgs}
hvgs <- getTopHVGs(gene_var, prop=0.1)
length(hvgs)
hvgs[1:10]
```

The result is a vector of gene IDs ordered by their biological variance (i.e.
highest deviation from the trend line shown above). We can use this with
functions that accept a list of genes as option to restrict their analysis to
that subset of genes (e.g. when we do PCA later on).

We can visualise the expression of the top most-variable genes with a violin
plot for each gene using the `plotExpression()` function:

```{r plot_count_HVGtop20}
plotExpression(sce, features = hvgs[1:20], point_alpha = 0.05)
```

# Dimensionality Reduction 

Many scRNA-seq analysis procedures involve comparing cells based on their
expression values across thousands of genes. Thus, each individual gene
represents a dimension of the data (and the total number of genes represents the
"dimensionality" of the data). More intuitively, if we had a scRNA-seq data set
with only two genes, we could visualise our data in a two-dimensional
scatterplot, with each axis representing the expression of a gene and each point
in the plot representing a cell. Intuitively, we can imagine the same for 3
genes, represented as a 3D plot. Although it becomes harder to imagine, this
concept can be extended to data sets with thousands of genes (dimensions), where
each cell’s expression profile defines its location in the high-dimensional
expression space.

As the name suggests, dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of
separate dimensions in the data. This is possible because different genes are
correlated if they are affected by the same biological process. Thus, we do not
need to store separate information for individual genes, but can instead
compress multiple features into a single dimension, e.g., an “eigengene”
(Langfelder and Horvath 2007). This reduces computational work in downstream
analyses like clustering, as calculations only need to be performed for a few
dimensions, rather than thousands. It also reduces noise by averaging across
multiple genes to obtain a more precise representation of the patterns in the
data. And finally it enables effective visualisation of the data, for those of
us who are not capable of visualizing more than 2 or 3 dimensions.

Here, we will cover three methods that are most commonly used in scRNA-seq
analysis:

- Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

Before we go into the details of each method, it is important to mention that
while the first method (PCA) can be used for downstream analysis of the data
(such as cell clustering), the latter two methods (t-SNE and UMAP) should only
be used for visualisation and not for any other kind of analysis.

## Principal Components Analysis

One of the most used and well-known methods of dimensionality reduction is
principal components analysis (PCA). This method performs a linear
transformation of the data, such that a set of variables (genes) are turned into
new variables called Principal Components (PCs).
These principal components combine information across several genes in a way
that best captures the variability observed across samples (cells).

Watch the video linked below for more details of how PCA works: 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgakZw6K1QQ" target="_blank">
<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/FgakZw6K1QQ/0.jpg" alt="StatQuest: PCA" height="200">
</a>

After performing a PCA, there is no data loss, i.e. the total number of
variables does not change. Only the fraction of variance captured by each
variable differs.

Each PC represents a dimension in the new expression space.
The first PC explains the highest proportion of variance possible.
The second PC explains the highest proportion of variance not explained by the
first PC.
And so on: successive PCs each explain a decreasing amount of variance not
captured by the previous ones.


The advantage of using PCA is that the total amount of variance explained by the
first few PCs is usually enough to capture most of the signal in the data.
Therefore, we can exclude the remaining PCs without much loss of information.
The stronger the correlation between the initial variables, the stronger the
reduction in dimensionality. We will see below how we can choose how many PCs to
retain for our downstream analysis.

### Running PCA

As discussed in the [Preprocessing and QC](04_Preprocessing_And_QC.html)
section, _SingleCellExperiment_ objects contain a _slot_ that can store
representations of our data in reduced dimensions. This is useful as we can keep
all the information about our single-cell data within a single object.

The `runPCA()` function can be used to run PCA on a SCE object, and returns an
updated version of the single cell object with the PCA result added to the
`reducedDim` slot.

Importantly, we can also restrict the PCA to use only some of the features
(rows) of the object, which in this case we do by using the highly variable
genes we identified earlier.

```{r pca_computation}
sce <- runPCA(sce, subset_row = hvgs)
sce
```

We can see that the output shows a new `reducedDimNames` value called "PCA". 
We can access it by using the `reducedDim()` function:

```{r view_reducedDim}
reducedDim(sce, "PCA")[1:10, 1:5]
```

By default, `runPCA()` returns the first 50 PCs, but you can change this number
by specifying the `ncomponents` option.

One of the first things to investigate after doing a PCA is how much variance is
explained by each PC. This information is stored as an "attribute" (think of it
as additional information) attached to the PCA matrix above. The typical way to
view this information is using what is known as a "scree plot".

```{r scree_plot}
percent.var <- attr(reducedDim(sce), "percentVar")
plot(percent.var, log="y", xlab="PC", ylab="Variance explained (%)")
```

We can see how the two first PCs explain a substantial amount of the variance,
and very little variation is explained beyond 10-15 PCs.

To visualise our cells in the reduced dimension space defined by PC1 and PC2, we
can use the `plotReducedDim()` function.

```{r pca_plot_1}
plotReducedDim(sce, dimred = "PCA", colour_by = "SampleName")
```

The proximity of cells in this plot reflects the similarity of their expression
profiles.

We can also plot several PCs at once, using the `ncomponents` option:

```{r sce_pca_plotReducedDim}
plotReducedDim(sce, dimred = "PCA", ncomponents = 3, colour_by = "SampleName")
```

Although these plotting functions are useful for quickly visualising our data,
more customised visualisations can be used by using the `ggcells()` function,
which extends the regular `ggplot()` function, but to work directly from the SCE
object. We can use it in a similar manner as we use the regular `ggplot()`
function, except we can define aesthetics both from our `reducedDim` slot as
well as `colData` and even `assays` (to plot particular gene's expression).
Here is an example, where we facet our plot:

```{r ggcells}
ggcells(sce, aes(x = PCA.1, y = PCA.2, colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ SampleName) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", colour = "Sample")
```


### PCA Diagnostics 

There are a large number of potential confounders, artifacts and biases in
scRNA-seq data. One of the main challenges stems from the fact that it is
difficult to carry out true technical replication to distinguish biological and
technical variability. Here we will continue to explore how experimental
artifacts can be identified and removed.

One of the ways to achieve this is to calculate the association between our PC
scores and different variables associated with our cells such as sample groups,
number of detected genes, total reads per cell, percentage of mitochondrial
genes, etc. We can achieve this using the `getExplanatoryPCs()` function (and
associated plotting function), which calculates the variance in each PC
explained by those variables we choose:

```{r explanatory_variables}
explain_pcs <- getExplanatoryPCs(sce,
                                variables = c("sum",
                                              "detected",
                                              "SampleGroup",
                                              "SampleName",
                                              "subsets_Mito_percent")
                                )

plotExplanatoryPCs(explain_pcs/100)
```

We can see that PC1 can be explained mostly by individual samples
(`SampleName`), mitochondrial expression and mutation group (`SampleGroup`).

We can also compute the marginal R2 for each variable when fitting a linear
model regressing expression values for each gene against just that variable, and
display a density plot of the gene-wise marginal R2 values for the variables.

```{r explanatory_variables_correlation_plot}
plotExplanatoryVariables(sce,
                         variables = c(
                           "sum",
                           "detected",
                           "SampleGroup",
                           "SampleName",
                           "subsets_Mito_percent"
                         ))
```

This analysis indicates that individual and subtype have the highest explanatory
power for many genes, and we don't see technical covariates having as high
correlations. If that were the case, we might need to repeat the normalization
step while conditioning out for these covariates, or we would include them in
downstream analysis.


### Chosing the number of PCs 

The choice of the number of PCs we retain for downstream analyses is a decision
that is analogous to the choice of the number of HVGs to use. Using more PCs
will retain more biological signal at the cost of including more noise that
might mask said signal. Much like the choice of the number of HVGs, it is hard
to determine whether an “optimal” choice exists for the number of PCs. Even if
we put aside the technical variation that is almost always uninteresting, there
is no straightforward way to automatically determine which aspects of biological
variation are relevant; one analyst’s biological signal may be irrelevant noise
to another analyst with a different scientific question.

Most practitioners will simply set the number of PCs to a “reasonable” but
arbitrary value, typically ranging from 10 to 50. This is often satisfactory as
the later PCs explain so little variance that their inclusion or omission has no
major effect. For example, in our dataset, few PCs explain more than 1% of the
variance in the entire dataset.

```{r pcs_with_variance_gt_1, purl=FALSE}
table(percent.var > 1)
```

The most commonly used strategies to choose PCs for downstream analysis include: 

* selecting the top X PCs (with X typically ranging from 10 to 50)
* using the elbow point in the scree plot 
* using technical noise 
* using permutation

#### Elbow point

To choose the elbow point in our scree plot, we can use the following:

```{r choose_elbow}
chosen_elbow <- findElbowPoint(percent.var)
chosen_elbow
```

Here is our scree plot again, but this time with a vertical line indicating the
elbow point:

```{r plot_eblow_choice}
plot(percent.var)
abline(v=chosen_elbow, col="dodgerblue")
```

#### Denoising PCA

The assumption of this method is that the biology drives most of the variance
and hence should be captured by the first few PCs, while technical noise affects
each gene independently, hence it should be captured by later PCs.
Therefore, our aim in this approach is to find the minimum number of PCs that
explains more variance than the total technical variance across genes (estimated
from our mean-variance trend).

This method is implemented in the `denoisePCA()` function:

```{r denoisePCA, warning=FALSE}
sce.denoised <- denoisePCA(sce, technical = gene_var)
```

If we look at our PCA result, we can see that it has 
`r ncol(reducedDim(sce.denoised, "PCA"))` columns. 

```{r denoisePCA_number_of_PCs}
ncol(reducedDim(sce.denoised, "PCA"))
```

#### Permutation

We do not demonstrate this method, as it is more code intensive. 
The idea is to permute (or "shuffle") a subset of the data, rerun the PCA and
calculate the percentage of variance explained by each PC on this "random"
dataset.
We can then compare the observed variance explained in the original data with
this null or random expectation and determine a cutoff where the observed
variance explained drops to similar values as the variance explained in the
shuffled data.

```{r permutation_example, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# mock example
tibble(Observed = percent.var) %>%
  rowid_to_column("PC") %>% 
  mutate(Permuted = 1) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Observed, Permuted), values_to = "Variance") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(PC, Variance)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = name), position = position_dodge()) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 8, linetype = 2) +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = 8.1, y = 5, label = "PC8", hjust = 0) +
    labs(fill = "", y = "% variance explained") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(1, 1), legend.justification = c(1, 1))
```

In this example (which is for illustration only) we may define a threshold at
PC8, since after that the variance explained in the observed data drops below
the levels in the permuted (randomised) data.

## t-SNE: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) approach addresses the
main shortcoming of PCA, which is that it can only capture linear
transformations of the original variables (genes). Instead, t-SNE allows for
non-linear transformations, while preserving the local structure of the data.
This means that neighbourhoods of similar samples (cells, in our case) will
appear together in a t-SNE projection, with distinct cell clusters separating
from each other.

As you can see below, compared to PCA we get much tighter clusters of samples,
with more structure in the data captured by two t-SNE axis, compared to the two
first principal components.

```{r tsne_example, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
sce %>% 
  runTSNE(dimred = "PCA") %>% 
  ggcells(aes(TSNE.1, TSNE.2, colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(colour = "Sample")
```

We will not go into the details of the algorithm here, but briefly it involves
two main steps:

- Calculating a similarity matrix between every pair of samples. This similarity
is scaled by a _Normal_ distribution, such that points that are far away from
each other are "penalised" with a very low similarity score. The variance of
this normal distribution can be thought of as a "neighbourhood" size when
computing similarities between cells, and is parameterised by a term called
**perplexity**.

- Then, samples are projected on a low-dimensional space (usually two
dimensions) such that the similarities between the points in this new space are
as close as possible to the similarities in the original high-dimensional space.
This step involves a stochastic algorithm that "moves" the points around until
it converges on a stable solution. In this case, the similarity between samples
is scaled by a t-distribution (that's where the "t" in "t-SNE" comes from),
which is used instead of the _Normal_ to guarantee that points within a cluster
are still distinguishable from each other in the 2D-plane (the t-distribution
has "fatter" tails than the Normal distribution).

Watch this video if you want to learn more about how t-SNE works:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEaUSP4YerM" target="_blank">
<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/NEaUSP4YerM/0.jpg" alt="StatQuest: t-SNE" height="200">
</a>

There are two important points to remember:

- the **perplexity** parameter, which indicates the relative importance of the
local and global patterns in the structure of the data set. The default value in
the functions we will use is 50, but different values should be tested to ensure
consistency in the results.
- **stochasticity**: because the t-SNE algorithm is stochastic, running the
analysis multiple times will produce slightly different results each time
(unless we set a "seed" for the random number generator).

See this interactive article on "[How to Use t-SNE
Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)", which illustrates how
changing these parameters can lead to widely different results.

Importantly, because of the non-linear nature of this algorithm, strong
interpretations based on how distant different groups of cells are from each
other on a t-SNE plot are discouraged, as they are not necessarily meaningful.
This is why it is often the case that the x- and y-axis scales are omitted from
these plots (as in the example above), as they are largely uninterpretable.
Therefore, **the results of a t-SNE projection should be used for visualisation
only and not for downstream analysis (such as cell clustering)**.

### Running t-SNE

Similarly to how we did with PCA, there are functions that can run a t-SNE
directly on our SingleCellExperiment object. We will leave this exploration for
you to do in the following exercises, but the basic code is very similar to that
used with PCA. For example, the following would run t-SNE with default options:

```{r basic_tsne}
sce <- runTSNE(sce)

plotTSNE(sce, colour_by = "SampleName")

```

One thing to note here is that, because of the computational demands of this
algorithm, the general practice is to run it on the PCA results rather than on
the full matrix of normalised counts.
The reason is that, as we've seen earlier, the first few PCs should capture most
of the biologically meaningful variance in the data, thus reducing the influence
of technical noise in our analysis, as well as substantially reducing the
computational time to run the analysis.

Let's explore more about t-SNE in the following exercise. 

:::exercise

See the accompanying worksheet for this session, which includes the code below
for the exercise. We want to achieve the following:

- Add a t-SNE projection of the data to our SCE object

- Explore how the main tuneable parameter of the algorithm - perplexity -
affects the results

```

Some things to note from our data exploration: 

- Changing the random seed doesn't seem to _qualitatively_ change the results
dramatically. The same groups of cells are still seen. However, their relative
position on the axis might change from run to run.
- Low perplexities will favour resolution of finer structure, possibly to the
point that the visualization is compromised by random noise. Thus, it is
advisable to test different perplexity values to ensure that the choice of
perplexity does not drive the interpretation of the plot.
- Exploring the expression of known marker genes (from literature or previous
experiments we might have done) may help us interpret these plots and judge
whether a particular choice of perplexity is adequate to represent the expected
cell types in our data.

## UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

Simiarly to t-SNE, UMAP performs a non-linear transformation of the data to
project it down to lower dimensions.
One difference to t-SNE is that this method claims to preserve both local and
global structures (i.e. the relative positions of clusters are, most of the
times, meaningful).
However, it is worth mentioning that there is some debate as to whether this is
always the case, as is explored in this recent paper by [Chari, Banerjee and
Pachter (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696).

Compared to t-SNE, the UMAP visualization tends to have more compact visual
clusters with more empty space between them. It also attempts to preserve more
of the global structure than t -SNE. From a practical perspective, UMAP is much
faster than t-SNE, which may be an important consideration for large datasets.

Similarly to t-SNE, since this is a non-linear method of dimensionality
reduction, **the results of a UMAP projection should be used for visualisation
only and not for downstream analysis (such as cell clustering)**.


### Running UMAP

Running UMAP is very similar to what we've seen already for PCA and t-SNE, only
the function name changes:

```{r runUMAP}
set.seed(123)
sce <- runUMAP(sce)

plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = "SampleName")

```

Because this UMAP also involves a series of randomization steps, setting the
random-generator seed (as we did above) is critical if we want to obtain
reproducible results after each run.

Like t-SNE, UMAP has its own suite of hyperparameters that affect the
visualization. Of these, the number of neighbors (n_neighbors) and the minimum
distance between embedded points (min_dist) have the greatest effect on the
granularity of the output. If these values are too low, random noise will be
incorrectly treated as high-resolution structure, while values that are too high
will discard fine structure altogether in favor of obtaining an accurate
overview of the entire dataset. Again, it is a good idea to test a range of
values for these parameters to ensure that they do not compromise any
conclusions drawn from a UMAP plot.

See this interactive article that goes into more depth about the underlying
methods, and explores the impacts of changing the n_neighbours and min_dist
parameters:
[Understanding UMAP](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/).

Similarly to what we did with t-SNE, we will explore this further in the
following exercise.


:::exercise

The following code can be found in the accompanying worksheet for this section. 
Our main objectives are: 

- Add a UMAP projection of the data to our SCE object
- Explore how the main tuneable parameter of the algorithm - neighbourhood size - affects the results
- Compare how UMAP compares to t-SNE in terms of revealing structure in the data

```{r exercise2, eval=FALSE}
# Run UMAP ----

# Part A
# run the UMAP with 50 neighbours
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducibility
sce <- runUMAP(sce, 
               name = "UMAP_neighbors50",
               dimred = "PCA",
               FIXME)

# Part B
# visualise the resulting UMAP projection (colour cells by sample)
FIXME

# Part C
# run the UMAP with 5 and 500 neighbours and compare the results
FIXME

# Part D
# compare the UMAP projection with the t-SNE projections 
# would you prefer one over the other?
FIXME
```

<details><summary>Hint A</summary>

Check out the ?runUMAP help page, there should be an argument for fixing the number of nearest neighbours.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint B</summary>

You can use the same code as for plotting the TSNE but replacing the arguments to display the UMAP output data.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint C</summary>

Change the number of neighbours argument in the runUMAP() function to see what changes.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint C</summary>

Redraw the TSNE and compare it with your UMAP.

Here is the complete script: 

```{r exercise2_solution, eval=FALSE}
# Run UMAP ----

# run the UMAP with 50 neighbours
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducibility
sce <- runUMAP(sce, 
               name = "UMAP_neighbors50",
               dimred = "PCA",
               n_neighbors = 50)

# visualise the resulting UMAP projection
# colour cells by sample
ggcells(sce, aes(x = UMAP_neighbors50.1, y = UMAP_neighbors50.2, 
                 colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point()

# run the UMAP with 5 and 500 neighbours and compare the results
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducibility
sce <- runUMAP(sce, 
               name = "UMAP_neighbors5",
               dimred = "PCA",
               n_neighbors = 5)
sce <- runUMAP(sce, 
               name = "UMAP_neighbors500",
               dimred = "PCA",
               n_neighbors = 500)

ggcells(sce, aes(x = UMAP_neighbors5.1, y = UMAP_neighbors5.2, 
                 colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Neighbours = 5")
ggcells(sce, aes(x = UMAP_neighbors500.1, y = UMAP_neighbors500.2, 
                 colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Neighbours = 500")

# compare the UMAP projection with the t-SNE projections 
# would you prefer one over the other?
ggcells(sce, aes(x = TSNE_perplex50.1, y = TSNE_perplex50.2, 
                 colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point()
ggcells(sce, aes(x = UMAP_neighbors50.1, y = UMAP_neighbors50.2, 
                 colour = SampleName)) +
  geom_point()
```

To answer some of those questions:

- Increasing the number of neighbours used in the analysis results in some
apparent groups of cells being "merged" with each other. Conversely, picking too
small a size creates many groups of cells, possibly picking up on some noise.
However, qualitatively the results are relatively robust to the number of
neighbours in this dataset, with the major groups of cells consistently
appearing together.
- Both t-SNE and UMAP show similar patterns in the data, so which one to pick in
this case seems to be a matter of personal preference. However, UMAP is a more
modern algorithm with better properties when it comes to keeping relative
positions between clusters.

# Save SCE object

Optionally, we can save our object, which now contains our dimensionality
reduction analysis in it.
This is useful as it will save time next time we pick up on our analysis. 

```{r save_dimRed_sce, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
saveRDS(sce, "Robjects/caron_dimRed.Rds")
```


# Extra: feature selection and dimensionality reduction with `Seurat`

<details><summary>Using the `Seurat` package</summary>

Seurat is another very popular scRNA-seq analysis package and provides useful
tools for analysing PCA loadings. We will convert our `SCE` object to a `Seurat`
object to use these tools.

```{r seurat_workflow, purl=FALSE}
# read our original SCE object
sce <- readRDS("R_objects/Caron_normalized.500.rds")

# convert SCE object to a Seurat object 
library(Seurat)
seurat_obj <- as.Seurat(sce, counts = "counts", data = "logcounts")

# identify the 2000 most highly-variable genes
seurat_hvgs <- FindVariableFeatures(seurat_obj, 
                                    selection.method = "vst", 
                                    nfeatures = 2000)

# scale the data for PCA for the highly variable genes 
seurat_obj <- ScaleData(seurat_obj, features = VariableFeatures(seurat_hvgs))

# run PCA 
seurat_obj <- RunPCA(seurat_obj, features = VariableFeatures(seurat_hvgs), 
                     verbose = FALSE)

# PCA Plot 
DimPlot(seurat_obj, reduction = "pca")
```

We can see that the PCA is similar to what we obtained before (there are some
differences, which are related to how the variable genes were chosen in this
case).

To visualise the top most correlated genes with each PC, we can use the
following:

```{r seurat_loadings, purl=FALSE}
VizDimLoadings(seurat_obj, dims=1:2)
```

This shows the genes that have highest loading (correlation) with each PC axis.
If we know something about the biology of the system we are studying, these may
give some clues as to what is driving the separation of cells along each PC
axis.

The loadings can also be visualised as a heatmap, showing the cells ordered by
the PC scores and the genes ordered by their loading along that PC:

```{r seurat_dimRed_heatmap, purl=FALSE}
DimHeatmap(seurat_obj, dims = 1:2, cells = 500, balanced = TRUE)
```

Look at 
[`Seurat`'s excellent documentation](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html) to
learn more about this and other uses of this package.

# Key Points and Resources

:::highlight

**Key Points:**

- Dimensionality reduction methods allow us to represent high-dimensional data
in lower dimensions, while retaining biological signal.
- The most common methods used in scRNA-seq analysis are PCA, t-SNE and UMAP.
- PCA uses a linear transformation of the data, which aims at defining new
dimensions (axis) that capture most of the variance observed in the original
data. This allows to reduce the dimension of our data from thousands of genes to
10-20 principal components.
- The results of PCA can be used in downstream analysis such as cell clustering,
trajectory analysis and even as input to non-linear dimensionality reduction
methods such as t-SNE and UMAP.
- t-SNE and UMAP are both non-linear methods of dimensionality reduction. They
aim at keeping similar cells together and dissimilar clusters of cells apart
from each other.
- Because these methods are non-linear, they should only be used for data
visualisation, and not for downstream analysis.
