# Overview

Some of the materials originate in the [Hemberg group course
material](https://biocellgen-public.svi.edu.au/mig_2019_scrnaseq-workshop/clustering-and-cell-annotation.html)
with some of the text copied with a few edits. Also see the OSCA book's ["Basic"](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.basic/clustering.html) and
["Advanced"](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.advanced/clustering-redux.html) 
chapters on clustering. In particular, please read the
[overview](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.basic/clustering.html#overview-1)
with regard to the comments on the "correctness" of any given clustering result.

Once we have normalized the data and removed confounders we can carry out
analyses that are relevant to the biological questions at hand. The exact nature
of the analysis depends on the data set. One of the most promising applications
of scRNA-seq is *de novo* discovery and annotation of cell-types based on
transcription profiles. This requires the identification of groups of cells
based on the similarities of the transcriptomes without any prior knowledge of
the label a.k.a. unsupervised clustering. To avoid the challenges caused by the
noise and high dimensionality of the scRNA-seq data, clustering is performed
after feature selection and dimensionality reduction. For data that has not 
required batch correction this would usually be based on the PCA output. As our data has
required batch correction we will use the "corrected" reducedDims data.

We will focus here on graph-based clustering, however, it is also possible to apply
hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering on smaller data sets - see the
[OSCA
book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.basic/clustering.html#vector-quantization-with-k-means)
for details. Graph-base clustering is a more recent development and better
suited for scRNA-seq, especially large data sets.

# Load the data

We will use the data set generated in the previous session. This contains 7
samples from the Caron data set. For the purposes of these materials, in the
interests of time, each sample has been downsampled to only contain 500 cells.

# Graph-based clustering overview

Graph-based clustering entails building a nearest-neighbour (NN) graph using
cells as nodes and their similarity as edges, then identifying 'communities' of
cells within the network. A graph-based clustering method has three key
parameters:

* How many neighbors are considered when constructing the graph  
* What scheme is used to weight the edges   
* Which community detection algorithm is used to define the clusters

## Connecting nodes (cells) based on nearest neighbours

Two types of NN graph may be used: "K nearest-neighbour" (KNN) and "shared
nearest-neighbour" (SNN). In a KNN graph, two nodes (cells), say A and B, are
connected by an edge if the distance between them is amongst the *k* smallest
distances from A to other cells. In an SNN graph A and B are connected if the
distance is amongst the *k* samllest distances from A to other cells and also
among the *k* smallest distance from B to other cells.

![](Images/KNNvSNN.svg){width=40%}

In the figure above, if *k* is 5, then A and B would be connected in a KNN graph
as B is one of the 5 closest cells to A, however, they would not be connected in
an SNN graph as B has 5 other cells that are closer to it than A.

The value of *k* can be roughly interpreted as the anticipated size of the
smallest subpopulation" (see [`scran`'s `buildSNNGraph()`
manual](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scran/man/buildSNNGraph.html)).

The plot below shows the same data set as a network built using three different
numbers of neighbours: 5, 15 and 25 (from
[here](https://biocellgen-public.svi.edu.au/mig_2019_scrnaseq-workshop/clustering-and-cell-annotation.html#example-1.-graph-based-clustering-deng-dataset)).

![](Images/bioCellGenGraphDeng.png)

## Weighting the edges

The edges between nodes (cells) can be weighted based on the similarity of the
cells; edges connecting cells that are more closely related will have a higher
weight. The three common methods for this weighting are (see [the *bluster* 
package documentation for the `makeSNNGraph` function](https://rdrr.io/github/LTLA/bluster/man/makeSNNGraph.html)):

* **rank** - the weight is based on the highest rank of the shared nearest
neighbours  
* **number** - the weight is based the number of nearest neighbours in common
between the two cells  
* **jaccard** - the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) 
of the two cells' sets of nearest neighbours.  

## Grouping nodes (cells) into clusters

Clusters are identified using an algorithm that interprets the connections
of the graph to find groups of highly interconnected cells. A variety of
different algorithms are available to do this, in these materials we will focus
on three methods: walktrap, louvain and leiden. See the [OSCA
book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.basic/clustering.html#overview-1)
for details of others available in *scran*.

## Modularity

Several methods to detect clusters ('communities') in networks rely on a metric
called "modularity". For a given partition of cells into clusters, modularity
measures how separated clusters are from each other, based on the difference
between the observed and expected weight of edges between nodes. For the whole
graph, the closer to 1 the better.

## Pros and Cons of graph based clustering

* Pros:
    + fast and memory efficient (avoids the need to construct a distance matrix
    for all pairs of cells)
    + no assumptions on the shape of the clusters or the distribution of cells
    within each cluster
    + no need to specify a number of clusters to identify (but the size of the
    neighbourhood used affects the size of clusters)
* Cons:
    + loss of information beyond neighboring cells, which can affect community detection in regions with many cells.


# Implementation

The implementation of clustering in R is carried out using functions from a
number of different packages, in particular the *bluster* and *igraph* packages.
*scran* provides a handy "wrapper" function `clusterCells` that allows us use a
variety of different algorithms with one simple command.

By default `clusterCells` just returns a vector containing the cluster number
for each cell. We can also retrieve the intermediate statistics (varying
according to the algorithm used) and the SNN graph by specifying the *bluster*
argument `full = TRUE`. If you are only interested in retrieving the clusters,
this isn't necessary but in this first instance we will retrieve the graph and
visualise it. The default algorithm for clusterCells is Walktrap with k is set 
to 10 by default. The default edge weighting is “rank”.

```{r clustercells_default}
clustering1 <- clusterCells(sce, use.dimred="corrected", full=TRUE)
```

This has defined `r max(as.numeric(clustering1$clusters))` clusters with varying
numbers of cells:

```{r table_of_clusters}
table(clustering1$clusters)
```

The number of cells in the data set is large and plotting all the cells would
take too long, so we randomly choose 1000 nodes (cells) in the network before
plotting the resulting smaller network. Adding sample data to the graph and
plotting the results are done using the [*igraph*
package](https://igraph.org/r/doc/subgraph.html). Cells can be color-coded by
sample type:

```{r plot_knn_graph, fig.height=6, out.width = '100%'}
# extract the graph
snn.gr <- clustering1$objects$graph

# Add Sample group to vertices (nodes, ie cells)
V(snn.gr)$SampleGroup <- as.character(colData(sce)$SampleGroup)

# pick 1000 nodes randomly
set.seed(1423)
selectedNodes <- sample(3500, 1000)

# subset graph for these 1000 randomly chosen nodes
snn.gr.subset <- subgraph(snn.gr, selectedNodes)

# set colors for clusters
grps <-  V(snn.gr.subset)$SampleGroup
cols <- c("dodgerblue", "lightyellow")[as.numeric(factor(grps))]
names(cols) <- grps

# plot graph
plot.igraph(snn.gr.subset,
  layout = layout_with_fr(snn.gr.subset),
  vertex.size = 3, 
  vertex.label = NA,
  vertex.color = cols,
  frame.color = cols,
  main = "default parameters"
)

# add legend
legend('bottomright',
       legend=unique(names(cols)),
       pch=21,
       pt.bg=unique(cols),
       pt.cex=1, cex=.6, bty="n", ncol=1)
```

More commonly we will visualise the clusters by superimposing them on a t-SNE or
UMAP plot. We can store the clusters in the `sce` object `colData`.

```{r plot_tsne_default_clusters, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
sce$Clusters1 <- clustering1$clusters
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by="Clusters1",
               text_by = "Clusters1")
```


# The Walktrap method

The walktrap method relies on short random walks (a few steps) through the
network. These walks tend to be 'trapped' in highly-connected regions of the
network. Node similarity is measured based on these walks. Nodes are first each
assigned their own community. Pairwise distances are computed and the two
closest communities are grouped. These steps are repeated a given number of
times to produce a dendrogram. Hierarchical clustering is then applied to the
distance matrix. The best partition is that with the highest modularity. The
original article describing the algorithm is [Pons P, Latapy M (2006) Computing
communities in large networks using random walks. J Graph Algorithms Appl
10(2):191–218](http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0512106)

Walktrap is the default algorithm for `clusterCells`, *k* is set to 10 by
default and the default edge weighting is "rank". To explicitly request a
specific algorithm and to set the *k* to a different number of nearest
neighbours, we use a `SNNGraphParam` object from the *bluster* package (which is
the package *clusterCells* is using under the hood).

Let's set the *k* to 15 but keep the other parameters the same. This time we
will just return the clusters:

```{r clustercells_walktrap_k15}
sce$walktrap15 <- clusterCells(sce, 
                           use.dimred = "corrected", 
                           BLUSPARAM = SNNGraphParam(k = 15, 
                                                     cluster.fun = "walktrap"))
```

This time we have defined `r max(as.numeric(sce$walktrap15))` clustering. As a
general rule, increasing *k* will tend to decrease the number of clusters (not
always, but generally).

```{r table_clusters_walktrap_k15}
table(sce$walktrap15)
```

We can visualise the assignment of cells from different samples to the clusters
using a heatmap. This gives us an overview of how well each cluster is 
represented across the samples and the replicates. Several clusters (2, 8, 9 
and 16) are present in the PBMMC samples, but absent from the ETV6_RUNX1 samples 
for instance.


```{r heatmap_walktrap_k15, fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
w15_table <- log(table(sce$walktrap15, sce$SampleName)+1)
pheatmap(w15_table, cluster_rows = TRUE, cluster_cols = FALSE)
```

Most clusters comprise cells from several replicates of the same sample type,
cluster 10 appears to be predominantly cells from the ETV6-RUNX samples.

We can visualise this on the TSNE:

```{r plot_tsne_walktrap_k15, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by="walktrap15", 
               text_by = "walktrap15")
```


```{r plot_tsne_walktrap_k15_samplegroup, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by="walktrap15", 
               text_by = "walktrap15",
               other_fields = list("SampleGroup")) +
  facet_wrap(vars(SampleGroup))
```


The different clustering algorithms may have additional parameters, specific to
the algorithm, that can be adjusted. With the walktrap algorithm we could also
tweak the number of "steps" in each walk. The default is 4, but we could, for
example, change this to 10 by adding the parameter `cluster.args = list(steps =
10)` to the `SNNGraphParam` object in the `clusterCells` command.

# The Louvain method

With the Louvain method, nodes are also first assigned their own community. This
hierarchical agglomerative method then progresses in two-step iterations: 

1. nodes are re-assigned one at a time to the community for which they increase
modularity the most, if at all. 
2. a new, 'aggregate' network is built where nodes are the communities formed in
the previous step.

These two steps are repeated until modularity stops increasing. The diagram
below is copied from [this
article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z#Fig1).

<img src="Images/leiden_Fig1_HTML.png" style="margin:auto; display:block" />

We now apply the Louvain approach, store its outcome in the SCE object and show
cluster sizes.

```{r clustercells_louvain_k15}
sce$louvain15 <- clusterCells(sce, 
                           use.dimred = "corrected", 
                           BLUSPARAM = SNNGraphParam(k = 15, 
                                                     cluster.fun = "louvain"))
```


```{r table_clusters_louvain_k15}
table(sce$louvain15)
```

The t-SNE plot shows cells color-coded by cluster membership:

```{r plot_tsne_louvain_k15, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by = "louvain15", 
               text_by = "louvain15")
```

If we split by sample type we can see differences in the clusters between the
sample groups:

```{r plot_tsne_louvain_k15_samplegroup, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by="louvain15", 
               text_by = "louvain15",
               other_fields = list("SampleGroup")) +
   facet_wrap(vars(SampleGroup))
```

# The Leiden method

The Leiden method improves on the Louvain method by guaranteeing that at each
iteration clusters are connected and well-separated. The method includes an
extra step in the iterations: after nodes are moved (step 1), the resulting
partition is refined (step2) and only then the new aggregate network made, and
refined (step 3). The diagram below is copied from [this
article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z#Fig3).

<img src="../Images/leiden_Fig3_HTML.png" style="margin:auto; display:block" />

:::exercise

For this exercise please run the clustering again, this time using the "leiden"
method.

Set the *k* to *20* and add the results of the clustering to the `sce` object
in a new column called "leiden20".

How many clusters does this result in?

Visualize the clusters by plotting the t-SNE with the cells coloured according
to your new clustering.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
 
You will need to change the `k` parameter and the `cluster.fun` parameter
in the SNNGraphParam object used in the `clusterCells` function.

</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

First run the clustering with `clusterCells`:

```{r exercise_1_answer_a, purl=FALSE}
sce$leiden20 <- clusterCells(sce, 
                           use.dimred = "corrected", 
                           BLUSPARAM = SNNGraphParam(k = 20, 
                                                     cluster.fun = "leiden"))
```

We can quickly look at the results by summarising using `table`.

```{r exercise_1_answer_b, purl=FALSE}
table(sce$leiden20)
```

There are `r max(as.numeric(sce$leiden20))` clusters, although cluster 7
contains only 3 cells and cluster 8 contains only 1 cell.

The t-SNE plot shows cells color-coded by cluster membership:

```{r exercise_1_answer_c, purl=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by = "leiden20", 
               text_by = "leiden20")
```

# Assessing cluster behaviour

A variety of metrics are available to aid us in assessing the behaviour of a 
particular clustering method on our data. These can help us in assessing how
well defined different clusters within a single clustering are in terms of
the relatedness of cells within the cluster and the how well separated that
cluster is from cells in other clusters, and to compare the results of 
different clustering methods or parameter values (e.g. different values
for *k*).

We will consider "Silhouette width" and "Modularity". Further details and 
other metrics are described in the ["Advanced" section of the OSCA book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.advanced/clustering-redux.html#quantifying-clustering-behavior).

## Silhouette width

The silhouette width (so named after the look of the traditional graph for
plotting the results) is a measure of how closely related cells within cluster
are to one another versus how closely related cells in the cluster are to cells
in other clusters. This allows us to assess cluster separation.

For each cell in the cluster we calculate the the average distance to all other
cells in the cluster and the average distance to all cells in the next closest cluster.
The cells silhouette width is the difference between these divided by the
maximum of the two values. Cells with a large silhouette are strongly related to
cells in the cluster, cells with a negative silhouette width are more closely
related to other clusters.

We will use the `approxSilhouette` function from the *bluster* package. The 
resulting table gives us the silhouette width for each cell, the cluster it
belongs to, and which other cluster it is most closely related to.

```{r calculate_silhouette_widths}
sil.approx <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"),
                               clusters=sce$leiden20)
sil.approx
```

We can view the results in as a beeswarm plot. We colour each cell according to
either its current cluster or, if the cell has a negative silhouette width, the
cluster that it is closest to.

```{r silhouette_width_beeswarm, fig.width=14, fig.height=6}
plotSilBeeswarm <- function(silDat){
  silTab <- silDat %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    mutate(closestCluster = ifelse(width > 0, cluster, other) %>% factor())
  
  plt <- silTab %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=cluster, y=width, colour=closestCluster)) +
    ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(method="smiley", alpha=0.6) +
    theme_bw()
  
  plt <- scater:::.resolve_plot_colours(plt, silTab$closestCluster, "closestCluster", colour = TRUE)
  plt
}

p1 <- plotSilBeeswarm(sil.approx)
p2 <- plotReducedDim(sce, 
                     dimred = "TSNE_corrected", 
                     colour_by="leiden20", 
                     text_by = "leiden20")
p1 + p2
```

We could also look at the correspondence between different clusters by plotting
these numbers on a grid showing for each cluster number of cells in that cluster
that are closer to another cluster, colouring each tile by the proportion of the
total cells in the cluster that it contains. Ideally we would like to see a
strong diagonal band and only a few off-diagonal tiles containing small number
of cells.

```{r silhouette_width_grid}
plotSilGrid <- function(silDat){
  silDat %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    mutate(closestCluster = ifelse(width > 0, cluster, other) %>% factor()) %>% 
    count(cluster, closestCluster,  name="olap") %>% 
    group_by(cluster) %>% 
    mutate(total  = sum(olap)) %>% 
    mutate(proportion = olap / total) %>% 
    mutate(proportion = ifelse(cluster == closestCluster, proportion, -proportion)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = cluster, y = closestCluster)) +
      geom_tile(aes(fill = proportion)) +
      geom_text(aes(label = olap), size=5) +
      scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("#fc8d59", "#ffffbf", "#91cf60"),
                            limits = c(-1, 1)) +
      geom_vline(xintercept=seq(0.5, 30.5, by=1)) +
      geom_hline(yintercept=seq(0.5, 30.5, by=1), colour="lightgrey", linetype=2) +
      guides(fill = "none") +
      theme(
          aspect.ratio = 1,
          panel.background = element_blank())
}
plotSilGrid(sil.approx)
```

From these two plots we can see that clusters 7, 8 and 12 appear to have a good
degree of separation, however, clusters 7 and 8 only contains few cells, whilst there are
many cells in other clusters that appear closer to them than they are to their
assigned cluster. Perhaps clusters 7 and 8 needs to be merged with cluster 1. 

Let's do the same plots with the walktrap clusters generated with *k*=15.

```{r plot_silhouette_width_walktrap_k15, fig.width=18, fig.height=6}
sil.approx <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"),
                               clusters=sce$walktrap15)

wp1 <- plotSilBeeswarm(sil.approx)

wp2 <- plotReducedDim(sce, 
                     dimred = "TSNE_corrected", 
                     colour_by="walktrap15", 
                     text_by = "walktrap15")

wp3 <- plotSilGrid(sil.approx)

wp1 + wp2 + wp3
```

This clustering appears to have generated a set of clusters with slightly better
separatedness than the Leiden method with a *k* of 20.

And again with the louvain clusters:

```{r plot_silhouette_width_louvain_k15, fig.width=18, fig.height=6}
sil.approx <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"),
                               clusters=sce$louvain15)

lp1 <- plotSilBeeswarm(sil.approx)

lp2 <- plotReducedDim(sce, 
                     dimred = "TSNE_corrected", 
                     colour_by="louvain15", 
                     text_by = "louvain15")

lp3 <- plotSilGrid(sil.approx)

lp1 + lp2 + lp3
```

There seems to be a greater degree of overlap between these clusters,
perhaps more resolution would improve this clustering - we might 
consider reducing *k*.

##  Modularity to assess clusters quality

As mentioned earlier, the modularity metric is used in evaluating the
separatedness of clusters. Some of the clustering algorithms, e.g. Louvain,
seek to optimise this for the entire NN graph as part of their cluster
detection. Modularity is a ratio between the observed weights of the edges
within a cluster versus the expected weights if the edges were randomly
distributed between all nodes. Rather than calculating a single modularity value
for the whole graph, we can instead calculate a pair-wise modularity value
between each pair of clusters using the `pairwiseModularity` function from the
*bluster* package. For this we need to have the graph from the clustering, so we
will rerun the walktrap clustering with k=15 to obtain this. We can plot the
resulting ratios on a heatmap. We would expect the highest modularity values
to be on the diagonal.

```{r pairwise_modularity, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
walktrap15 <- clusterCells(sce, 
                           use.dimred = "corrected", 
                           BLUSPARAM = SNNGraphParam(k = 15, 
                                                     cluster.fun = "walktrap"),
                           full = TRUE)
g <- walktrap15$objects$graph
ratio <- pairwiseModularity(g, walktrap15$clusters, as.ratio=TRUE)

hm1 <- pheatmap(log2(ratio+1),
         cluster_rows=FALSE, 
         cluster_cols=FALSE,
         color=colorRampPalette(c("white", "blue"))(100))
```

We can compare this to the silhouette width grid

```{r plot_modularity_v_silhouette_widths, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
wp4 <- ggplotify::as.ggplot(hm1)
wp2 + wp3 + wp4
```


Largely, this reflects what we saw from the silhouette widths, but also reveals
some additional inter-connectedness between other clusters. We can also
visualise this as network graph where nodes are clusters and the edge weights
are the modularity.

```{r plot_modularity_network}
cluster.gr <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(log2(ratio+1),
                                                  mode="upper", 
                                                  weighted=TRUE, diag=FALSE)

set.seed(11001010)
plot(cluster.gr, 
     edge.width=igraph::E(cluster.gr)$weight*5,
     layout=igraph::layout_with_lgl)
```

## Comparing two sets of clusters

We can assess the concordance between different clustering methods to get a better idea of how they eachtreat the data, e.g. does one cluster from one method equate to just one cluster in the other or is it a combination of different clusters. This may be revealing about
the underlying biology. We will use the Jaccard index as measure of concordance
between clusters. A value of 1 represents perfect concordance between clusters
(i.e. they contain exactly the same cells).

```{r jaccard_index, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
jacc.mat <- linkClustersMatrix(sce$louvain15, sce$walktrap15)
rownames(jacc.mat) <- paste("Louvain", rownames(jacc.mat))
colnames(jacc.mat) <- paste("Walktrap", colnames(jacc.mat))
pheatmap(jacc.mat, color=viridis::viridis(100), cluster_cols=FALSE, cluster_rows=FALSE)
```

We can see that Louvain clusters 2, 6, 7, and 9 are equivalent to walktrap
clusters 14, 7, 12, and 11 respectively. The remaining Louvain clusters are
combinations of cells from various walktrap clusters. We may want to look at
marker genes for these clusters to assess what these two different views are
telling us about the biology.

# Cluster sweep

As we have seen, there are a number of different parameters we can change to
alter the final clustering result - primarily the *k* used to build the NN
graph, the edge weighting method and the clustering algorithm. There is no one
gold standard that will fit all data, so, in most cases, it is necessary to
assess a number of different clusterings to obtain one that provides a view of
the data that suits our biological interpretations. The `clusterSweep` function
allows us to apply a range of different parameters in one go and obtain the
clustering for each.

For example, suppose we wish to assess the effect of different values of *k* on
the walktrap clustering. We can parallelize this process to make it faster.

```{r clustersweep}
out <- clusterSweep(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"),
                    BLUSPARAM = NNGraphParam(),
                    k = as.integer(c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)),
                    cluster.fun = "walktrap",
                    BPPARAM=BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(7))
```

The resulting object is a list containing a DataFrame with the clusters for each
combination of the clustering parameters and a corresponding DataFrame showing
the parameters used to generate each of these:

```{r clustersweep_output}
out$clusters[,1:4]
out$parameters
```

We can then combine this cluster sweep with the metrics for assessing cluster
behaviour in order to get a overview of the effects of these parameter changes
that may enable us to make some decisions as to which clustering or clusterings
we may wish to investigate further.

Here we will just look at the mean silhouette width and the number of clusters.

```{r assess_clustersweep}
df <- as.data.frame(out$parameters)

# get the number of clusters
df$num.clusters <- apply(out$clusters, 2, max)

# get the mean silhouette width
getMeanSil <- function(cluster) {
    sil <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"), cluster)
    mean(sil$width)
}
df$silhouette <- map_dbl(as.list(out$clusters), getMeanSil)

nclPlot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = num.clusters)) + 
                  geom_line(lwd=2)
silPlot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = silhouette)) + 
                  geom_line(lwd=2)
nclPlot + silPlot
```

Based on our previous analysis and knowledge of the biology we may feel that 12
clusters represents a good number clusters, and we can see here that *k* = 25,
provides this. Also *k* = 25 gives us a better silhouette score than lower
values of *k*. On the other hand, perhaps *k* = 15 provides greater resolution
of cell types (more clusters) with only a slight decrease in the silhouette
score.

Earlier we looked at the Jaccard index as a means of comparing two different
clusterings. We could apply the same method here:

```{r clustersweep_jaccard_index, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
jacc.mat <- linkClustersMatrix(out$clusters$k.15_cluster.fun.walktrap, 
                               out$clusters$k.25_cluster.fun.walktrap)
rownames(jacc.mat) <- paste("Walktrap_15", rownames(jacc.mat))
colnames(jacc.mat) <- paste("Walktrap_25", colnames(jacc.mat))
pheatmap(jacc.mat, 
         color = viridis::viridis(100), 
         cluster_cols = FALSE, 
         cluster_rows = FALSE)
```

The [OSCA
book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA.advanced/clustering-redux.html#comparing-different-clusterings)
provides some additional methods for comparing different clusterings that can be
combined with the cluster sweep results to assess cluster behaviour under
different parameters.

In this section, we have just done a sweep changing the *k*, but it is also
possible to combine this with multiple clustering algorithms and multiple edge
weightings.

:::exercise

For this exercise, you will rerun `clusterSweep`with additional parameters.This time:

* test the walktrap, louvain and leiden methods
* test *k* set to 10, 15, 20 and 25

This will test 12 different clusterings.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

This time, as well as setting the *k* parameter to a vector that contains 10,
15, 20 and 25, you will also need to provide the `cluster.fun` parameter with a
vector containing the names of the three different clustering methods.

```{r exercise_2a_answer, purl=FALSE}
out <- clusterSweep(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"),
                    BLUSPARAM = NNGraphParam(),
                    k = as.integer(c(10, 15, 20, 25)),
                    cluster.fun = c("walktrap", "louvain", "leiden"),
                    BPPARAM=BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(7))
```

</details>

Now plot the number of clusters generated by each clustering and the mean
silhouette width. You will need to adjust the plotting parameters to plot a
different coloured line for each clustering algorithm (walktap, louvain and
leiden).

```{r exercise_2b_start_code, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
df <- as.data.frame(out$parameters)

# get the number of clusters
df$num.clusters <- apply(out$clusters, 2, max)

# get the mean silhouette width
getMeanSil <- function(cluster) {
    sil <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"), cluster)
    mean(sil$width)
}
df$silhouette <- map_dbl(as.list(out$clusters), getMeanSil)

nclPlot <- FIXME

silPlot <- FIXME

nclPlot + silPlot
```

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

You will need to add the term `aes(colour = cluster.fun)` into the `geom_line`
function. This will instruct ggplot2 to plot a different coloured line for each
clustering function.

```{r exercise_2b_answer, purl=FALSE}
df <- as.data.frame(out$parameters)

# get the number of clusters
df$num.clusters <- apply(out$clusters, 2, max)

# get the mean silhouette width
getMeanSil <- function(cluster) {
    sil <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"), cluster)
    mean(sil$width)
}
df$silhouette <- map_dbl(as.list(out$clusters), getMeanSil)

nclPlot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = num.clusters)) + 
                  geom_line(aes(colour=cluster.fun), lwd=2)
silPlot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = silhouette)) + 
                  geom_line(aes(colour=cluster.fun), lwd=2)
nclPlot + silPlot
```

</details>

**Bonus:** if you have time, select 1 or 2 of the clusterings, calculate the
silhouette widths and examine them further using the beeswarm plot and the
silhouette grid.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
We have not yet added the clusters to our sce object, so when running
`approxSilhouette` you will need to use the clustering directly from the
`clusters` object in the `out` list generated by `clusterSweep`.
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

For example, we could take a look at the leiden with k = 25, which results in 12
clusters and has the highest mean silhouette width.

```{r exercise_2_bonus_answer, purl=FALSE}
sil.approx <- approxSilhouette(reducedDim(sce, "corrected"), 
                               clusters=out$clusters$k.25_cluster.fun.leiden)

plotSilBeeswarm(sil.approx)

plotSilGrid(sil.approx)
```
</details>

:::

Finally, we can add all (or a subset) of the clusterings from `clusterSweep` to
our SCE object.

```{r add_clustersweep_output_to_sce}
colData(sce) <- cbind(colData(sce), DataFrame(out$clusters))
```


# Finalise clustering selection

When you have come to a decision about which clustering to use it is convenient
to add it to `colData` column called "label" using the `colLabels` function.
This means downstream code does not need to be changed should you later decide
to switch to a different clustering, you'd simply need to change the contents of
the "label" column. This also makes the code easily re-usable for different
analyses.

For now we will use the Leiden k=25 clustering.

```{r set_labels}
colLabels(sce) <- sce$k.25_cluster.fun.leiden
```


# Expression of known marker genes

If we expect our clusters to represent known cell types for which there are 
well established marker genes, we can now start to investigate the clusters
by plotting in parallel the expression of these genes. This can also help us
in assessing if our clustering has satisfactorily partitioned our cells.

```{r plot_tsne_leiden_k25, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               colour_by = "label", 
               text_by = "label") +
  ggtitle("Leiden k=25 clusters")
```

Having identified clusters, we now display the level of expression of cell type
marker genes to quickly match clusters with cell types. For each marker we will
plot its expression on a t-SNE, and show distribution across each cluster on a
violin plot.

We will be using gene symbols to identify the marker genes, so we will switch
the rownames in the SCE object to be gene symbols. We use the scater function
`uniquifyFeatureNames` to do this as there are a few duplicated gene symbols.

```{r symbols_to_rownames}
rownames(sce) <- uniquifyFeatureNames(rowData(sce)$ID, rowData(sce)$Symbol)
```

## B-cells markers

Let's look at the expression of the B cell marker CD79A.

```{r plot_tsne_b_cell_markers, fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               by_exprs_values = "logcounts",
               colour_by = "CD79A",
               text_by = "label")
```

```{r plot_expression_b_cell_markers, fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
plotExpression(sce, 
               exprs_values = "logcounts",
               x = "label", 
               colour_by = "label",
               features=c("CD79A"))
```

A large number of the clusters seem to represent B cells. This is what we expect from a cancer of B cells

## Monocyte markers

We have a very clear cluster of monocytes

```{r plot_tsne_monocyte_markers, fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
plotReducedDim(sce, 
               dimred = "TSNE_corrected",
               by_exprs_values = "logcounts",
               colour_by = "LYZ",
               text_by = "label")

```

```{r plot_expression_monocyte_markers, fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
plotExpression(sce, 
               exprs_values = "logcounts",
               x = "label", 
               colour_by = "label",
               features=c("LYZ"))
```
