# Introduction

In the course materials we performed QC and filtering of 2 samples from each
of the sample groups. For this challenge we would like you to perform QC and 
filtering on all of the samples from the Caron data set. 

# Load packages

```{r packages}
library(DropletUtils)
library(scater)
library(ensembldb)
library(AnnotationHub)
library(BiocParallel)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Sample meta data

We will load both the Caron and HCA data sets. We have already prepared a sample
meta data table that relates the sample/run ID to the sample group.

```{r load_samplesheet, message=FALSE}
samplesheet <- read_tsv("Data/sample_sheet.tsv")
```

**NOTE**: There are two PBMMC_1 samples. These are two libraries from the same
sample material. Later on, we will combine these to form a single sample, but 
for now we will need to rename them so that they are QC'd separately.

# Read CellRanger outputs into R

## Parallelisation

We first need to first set up some parallel parameters using the package
`BiocParallel`.

```{r parallelisation}
bp.params <- MulticoreParam(workers = 7)
```

## Load the data

:::exercise 
In order to load the CellRanger data for all of the samples, you will first
need to create a named vector of the paths to the filtered count matrix folders 
called `list_of_files` and then use this in the `read10xCounts` command. 

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
The paths to `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` directories for each sample can be
constructed using the **Sample** column as:   

<span style = "color: #545454; font-weight: bold;">Data/CellRanger_Outputs/<span style="color: #2e2892; font-style: italic;">*Sample*</span>/outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix</span>

You will need to use a function such as `str_c` or `paste`

The names of the vector will determine the sample name used in the counts 
matrix, this should be the 'SRR' number as in the **Sample** column of the
sample sheet.
</details>


<details><summary>Answer</summary>
```{r load_data, purl=FALSE}
samples_list <- samplesheet$Sample
list_of_files <- str_c("Data/CellRanger_Outputs/", 
                       samples_list, 
                       "/outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix")
names(list_of_files) <- samples_list

    
sce <- read10xCounts(list_of_files, col.names=TRUE, BPPARAM = bp.params)
```
</details>

## Check samples in the data set

A good sanity check is to look at the colData to ensure that we have all the
samples we are expecting and check the overall size of the new object.

```{r check_data_object}
colData(sce) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    select(Sample) %>% 
    distinct()
sce
```

## Modify the droplet annotation

We need to modify the cell barcodes so that they unique for each sample. 

We will also add information from the sample sheet to the droplet annotation.

```{r add_metadata}
sce$Barcode <- rownames(colData(sce))
colData(sce) <- merge(colData(sce), samplesheet, by="Sample", sort=FALSE)
rownames(colData(sce)) <- sce$Barcode
```

# Undetected genes

Remove undetected genes.

```{r detected_genes}
detected_genes <- rowSums(counts(sce)) > 0
sce <- sce[detected_genes,]
```

:::exercise

What proportion of genes have been detected

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
```{r percentage_detected}
mean(detected_genes)
```

Approximately `r round(mean(detected_genes), 3)*100` percent of genes were
detected in at least one sample.
</details>

:::

# Annotate genes

In order to assess the percentage of mitochondrial UMIs, we will need to be
able to identify mitochondrial genes. The simplest way to do this is to annotate
the genes with their chromosome of origin.

```{r annotate_genes}
ah <- AnnotationHub()
ens.hs.107<- query(ah, c("Homo sapiens", "EnsDb", 107))[[1]] 

genes <- rowData(sce)$ID
gene_annot <- AnnotationDbi::select(ens.hs.107, 
                                    keys = genes,
                                    keytype = "GENEID",
                                    columns = c("GENEID", "SEQNAME")) %>%
    set_names(c("ID", "Chromosome"))
rowData(sce) <- merge(rowData(sce), gene_annot, by = "ID", sort=FALSE)
rownames(rowData(sce)) <- rowData(sce)$ID

rowData(sce)
```


# Add per cell QC metrics

Now add the per cell QC metrics to the droplet annotation using the
function `addPerCellQC`.

```{r addPerCellQC}
is.mito <- which(rowData(sce)$Chromosome=="MT")

sce <- addPerCellQC(sce, subsets=list(Mito=is.mito), BPPARAM = bp.params)
```

# Explore QC metric distribution

Before moving on to do the actual cell filtering, it is always a good idea to
explore the distribution of the metrics across the droplets.

:::exercise
Use the `scater` function `plotColData` to generate plots showing the
distributions of the total number of UMIs, the number of genes detected and
percentage of UMIs aligned to mitochondrial genes across all cells for each
sample.

This time we will use `facet_wrap` to split the plot according to the Sample
Group. We will need to include the sample group in the plot data using the 
`other_fields` argument in `plotColData` (see the help page for details - 
`?plotColData`) in order that we can use it in the `facet_wrap` command. 

The code for plotting the total number of UMIs is shown below. You will also
need to plot the the number of genes detected and percentage of UMIs aligned to
mitochondrial.

```{r plot_library_size, eval = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
plotColData(sce, x="SampleName", y="sum", other_fields="SampleGroup") + 
    facet_wrap(~SampleGroup, nrow=1, scales = "free_x") + 
    scale_y_log10() + 
    ggtitle("Total count")
```

plotColData(sce, x="SampleName", y="detected", other_fields="SampleGroup") + 
    facet_wrap(~SampleGroup, nrow=1, scales = "free_x") + 
    scale_y_log10() + 
    ggtitle("Detected features")
```

```{r plot_MT_content, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
plotColData(sce, 
            x="SampleName", 
            y="subsets_Mito_percent", 
            other_fields="SampleGroup") + 
    facet_wrap(~SampleGroup, nrow=1, scales = "free_x") +
    ggtitle("Mito percent")
```
</details>

```{r total_UMI_plot, echo = FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
plotColData(sce, x="SampleName", y="sum",other_fields="SampleGroup") + 
    facet_wrap(~SampleGroup, nrow=1, scales = "free_x") +

# Identification of low-quality cells with adaptive thresholds

:::exercise

Use the scater function `quickPerCellQC` to assess cell quality based
on the three metrics. Name the object generated `cell_qc_results`.  

When running the command, consider the distribution plots above and decide
whether to use the `batch` option and if so, at what level it should be
applied.

How many cells will be removed from the data set?


<details><summary>Hint</summary>
With these samples we have three possible "batch" levels at which we could 
run adaptive filtering. We could apply the filtering across all samples 
together (i.e. no `batch`), we could apply it by sample group (ETV6-RUNX1, 
HHD, PBMMC, PRE-T), or we could apply it per sample. 
</details>


<details><summary>Answer</summary>
It is clear that there are significantly different distribution profiles
between samples in the same group. Noticeably the distribution profiles for the
two PBMMC_1 samples are quite different - it would appear that PBMMC_1b has a
lower overall UMI count indicating less sequencing. For this reason it may be
prudent to apply the adaptive filtering to each sample independently.

```{r quickPerCellQC_batch, purl=FALSE}
cell_qc_filters <- quickPerCellQC(colData(sce),
                                percent_subsets=c("subsets_Mito_percent"),
                                batch=sce$Sample)
as.data.frame(cell_qc_filters) %>% summarise(across(everything(), sum))
```

In total `r sum(cell_qc_filters$discard)` cells will be removed from the
dataset.

</details>

:::

Let's add the columns in the droplet annotation with these new filters.

```{r quickPerCellQC_batch_add}
colData(sce) <- cbind(colData(sce), cell_qc_filters)
```

We can visualise how the new filters look using violin plots.

```{r plot_library_size_filtering, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
plotColData(sce, 
            x="SampleName", 
            y="sum",
            other_fields="SampleGroup", 
            colour_by = "low_lib_size") + 
    facet_wrap(vars(SampleGroup), nrow=1, scales = "free_x") + 
    scale_y_log10() + 
    labs(y = "Total count", title = "Total count") +
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Discarded"))
```

```{r plot_detected_genes_filtering, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
plotColData(sce, 
            x="SampleName", 
            y="detected",
            other_fields="SampleGroup", 
            colour_by = "low_n_features") + 
    facet_wrap(vars(SampleGroup), nrow=1, scales = "free_x") + 
    scale_y_log10() + 
    labs(y = "Genes detected", title = "Genes detected") +
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Discarded"))
```

```{r plot_MT_content_filtering, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
plotColData(sce, 
        x="SampleName", 
        y="subsets_Mito_percent",
        other_fields="SampleGroup", 
        colour_by = "high_subsets_Mito_percent") + 
    facet_wrap(vars(SampleGroup), nrow=1, scales = "free_x") + 
    labs(y = "Percentage mitochondrial UMIs",
         title = "Mitochondrial UMIs") +
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Discarded"))
```
